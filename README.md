# Mersenne Twister in Python

This code defines a class called MersenneTwister, which generates pseudo-random numbers based on the Mersenne Twister algorithm. 
The class takes a seed as an argument, which initializes the generator. 
The initialize_generator() method initializes the generator state based on the seed, while the generate_numbers() method generates a new series of pseudo-random numbers. 
The extract_number() method extracts a single pseudo-random number from the generator state. 
The returned number is a 32-bit float between 0 and 1. 
The Mersenne Twister algorithm is a widely used algorithm for generating pseudo-random numbers, and this implementation provides a simple and efficient way to generate random numbers in Python.
